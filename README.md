# Open Source Masters in Climate Science & Climate Policy 

Compiling this as a resource for myself for my work as a data scientist working with the Special Presidential Envoy for Climate and the Bureau of Oceans and International Scientific Affairs. I want to learn so much more both about the fundamental science of climate and energy systems and about law & negotiations for global action. 

## Climate Law, Paris Agreement, and Negotiations

For search: [Climate Policy Radar](https://app.climatepolicyradar.org/) and the spinoff [Global Stocktake Explorer](https://gst1.org/) are helpful resources 

### Law
